# Getting Started with Git Branches

This repository is using Git for version control. Below are instructions on how to work with branches using both Visual Studio Code and GitHub.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and set up:

- Git: Install Git from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).
- Visual Studio Code: Download and install VS Code from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- GitHub Account: Create an account on GitHub if you haven't already.

## Creating a New Branch

### Using Visual Studio Code

1. Open your project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Click on the `Source Control` icon in the sidebar (usually looks like a branch).
3. Click on the `Branches` button (it looks like two branches).
4. Enter the name for your new branch in the input field and press `Enter`.

### Using GitHub

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the `Branch: main` button near the top left of the repository page.
3. Enter the name for your new branch in the text box under "Find or create a branch".
4. Press `Enter` to create the new branch.

## Pushing Multiple Files to the Branch

1. Make the necessary changes to your files in the project directory.
2. Stage the changes using the `git add` command:

```bash
git add .
```

3. Commit the changes with a descriptive message:

```bash
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message here"
```

4. Push the changes to the new branch:

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of your newly created branch.

## Changing Branches

To switch to a different branch, use the following command:

```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you want to switch to.

## Checking the Status

To check the status of your repository (e.g., which files have been modified, which branch you're on), use the following command:

```bash
git status
```

## Additional Commands

- To see a list of all branches in your repository, use `git branch`.
- To delete a branch, use `git branch -d <branch-name>`.
